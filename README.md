# Meralus: yet another attempt to create minecraft-like game

### Some tips

Executable must be in the same folder as the `resources` folder.

### Binds

- Walking: `WASD`
- Jumping: `Space`
- Running: `Shift + W` (does not work with `S`)
- ~~\[Debugging\] Toggle Wireframes: `T`~~
- ~~\[Debugging\] Select a block under the player for debugging: `Ctrl + F`~~

### what does the `meralus` mean?

`mera` (`मेरा`) is `mine` in Hindi, and `alus` is `craft` in Finnish.

YEAH, I'M GOOD AT NAMING THINGS.

#### uhh???

lol weird physics (i suck at math (and shaders too))

~~btw just a thought, but maybe i'll switch from `macroquad` to something else (either `bevy` or my own wrapper over opengl)~~ **WIP!**
