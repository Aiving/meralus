# Meralus: yet another attempt to create minecraft-like game

### Some tips

If you really plan to play this (and compile it yourself), replace all paths from `/home/aiving/dev/meralus` with your path to the cloned repo.

### Binds

Walking: `WASD`
Jumping: `Space`
Running: `Ctrl + W` (does not work with `S`)
\[Debugging\] Toggle Wireframes: `T`
\[Debugging\] Select a block under the player for debugging: `Ctrl + F`

#### uhh???

yeah lol weird physics (i'm suck at math (and shaders too))

btw just a thought, but maybe i'll switch from `macroquad` to something else (either `bevy` or my own wrapper over opengl)
