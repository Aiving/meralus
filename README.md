# Meralus: yet another attempt to create minecraft-like game

Walking: `WASD`
Jumping: `Space`
Running: `Ctrl + W` (does not work with `S`)
\[Debugging\] Toggle Wireframes: `T`
\[Debugging\] Select a block under the player for debugging: `Ctrl + F`

yeah lol weird physics (i'm suck at math (and shaders too))

btw just a thought, but maybe i'll switch from `macroquad` to something else (either `bevy` or my own wrapper over opengl)
